# PlaywrightPython
Sample Test automation framework in Playwright,Pytest and python

# Overview
This repository contains a robust automation testing framework built with Python, Playwright, and pytest for both UI and API testing. The framework supports testing web applications and REST APIs, integrates with Allure for detailed reporting, and is designed to run in a Continuous Integration (CI) environment like Jenkins.

# Features
* UI Testing: Automated browser testing using Playwright for Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit.
* API Testing: REST API testing using the requests library and Playwright's API request context.
* Reporting: Detailed test reports generated with Allure, including screenshots and API responses.
* Configuration: Centralized configuration management via YAML files.
* CI/CD Integration: Designed to run on Jenkins for automated testing in CI pipelines.
* Modular Design: Uses the Page Object Model (POM) for maintainable and scalable test code.

# Prerequisites
Before using this framework, ensure the following tools are installed:

* Python 3.8+
* Node.js (for Playwright browser installation)
* pip (Python package manager)
* Git (for version control)
* Jenkins (optional, for CI/CD)
